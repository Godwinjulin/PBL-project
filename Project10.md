## CONFIGURE NGINX AS A LOAD BALANCER

         steps are giving below.
    
spin up an EC2 VM based on Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS 

Name it Nginx LB

I opened TCP port 80 for HTTP connections, also opened TCP port 443 which is used for secured HTTPS connections.

I UpdateD /etc/hosts file for the local DNS with Web Serversâ€™ names ( Web1, Web2 and web3) their their local IP addresses.

Installed and configured Nginx as a load balancer to point traffic to the resolvable DNS names of the webservers with the command below.

           sudo apt update

           sudo apt install nginx

Opened the default nginx configuration file with the command below.

          sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
     
       #insert following configuration into http section

       upstream myproject {
        server Web1 weight=5;
        server Web2 weight=5;
        server web3 weight=5;
      }

       server {
       listen 80;
       server_name www.practicelab.link;
       location / {
        proxy_pass http://myproject;
       }
    }

      #comment out this line
          # include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;

Restart Nginx with the command below to checked if  the service is up and running.
     
          sudo systemctl restart nginx
     
          sudo systemctl status nginx
